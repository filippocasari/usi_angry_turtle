## Running the points
Each assignement point has its own python file and you can run them with the following commands:
```sh
colcon build --packages-select usi_angry_turtle
. install/local_setup.bash 
ros2 run usi_angry_turtle point4 turtlesim_node
```

Obviously, you have to set "point" and then ( 1, 2, 3 or 4) to run each point within the last bash command.
